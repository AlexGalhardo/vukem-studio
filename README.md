<h3><strong>Open source studio for short-form video</strong></h3>

</div>

## Introduction

Studio turns a video brief into a rendered MP4 for Shorts, Reels, and other short social cuts. The dashboard collects the goal, the audience, and the visual style. A compiler writes the prompt. A worker renders the file with open source tools.

The application is a [Vukem](https://vukem.dev) app: Inertia, React, and a sidebar. `/` is the dashboard. A signed-out visitor goes to `/login`, which has one Google button; only two allowlisted Google accounts (`accounts.AllowedEmails`) may sign in. **Videos** is the library. A brief compiles a prompt, a local planner writes the scene plan, and FFmpeg writes one MP4. The job stores the prompt. Download is offered only when the check passes. The documentation site, the research, and the skill kits live in the same repository. The public hostname is still the docs site.

Opening [studio.vukem.dev](https://studio.vukem.dev) lands on the technical documentation.

## Stability

Studio follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org) and tags releases as `vX.Y.Z` on `main`. The first release is `v0.1.0`.

Changes are listed in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md), which follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

The work still ahead is tracked in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md). A box marked `[/]` is only partly done.

## Contributing

Thank you for considering a contribution to Studio.

- Read [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) and the docs under `site/content` before changing behavior.
- Keep the repository in English.
- Run the check that covers your change. For the app that is `go test ./...` and `bun run typecheck`. The render tests need `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` on `PATH`. For the docs site that is `bun run check` and `npm run check:mdx` inside `site/`.
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` under `[Unreleased]` when behavior, commands, or conventions change.

The full guide is in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Pull requests

1. Create a branch from `main`.
2. Make one logical change per commit.
3. Open a pull request against `main`.

`main` accepts changes only through a pull request with green required checks and linear history.

### Commits

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) in English: `type(scope): description`.

- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `perf`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`, `style`, `revert`.
- The subject starts with a lowercase letter and does not end with a period.

Enable the local hook once:

```bash
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

The pull request title workflow checks the same rule in CI.
